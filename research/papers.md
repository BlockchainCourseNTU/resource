# Curated Blockchain Papers

This is a curated (white)paper list consisting of various topics related to blockchain technologies.
To aid your decisions on which ones to prioritize, we have appended a "relevance/significance rating" at the back of each item (10 means highly recommended).
Please be noted that this rating is by no means an impartial assessment of those papers, it is highly subjective!

## Project Whitepapers

## Consensus

- [PBFT](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) -- 10

  - seminal work on practical BFT, the foundation of emerging blockchain consensus, especially for PoS chains

- [Paxos Made Simple](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) -- 5

  - A simplified explanation of Paxo Algorithm, one of the earliest consensus protocol

- [Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) -- 8

  - [website](https://raft.github.io/)
  - Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. Widely used!
