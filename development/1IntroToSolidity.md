<h2> 1. Data Types </h2>
<h4> 1.1 Value Types </h4>
Value types are the data that is passed by value.
<h5> 1.1.1 Bool </h5>
<h5> 1.1.2 Integers </h5>
<h5> 1.1.3 Address </h5>
<h4> 1.2 Reference Types </h4>
<h4> 1.3 Data Structures </h4>
<h2> 2. Functions </h2>

* function name

* argType1 arg1, ...

* access classifier
   * public - all can access
   * external - cannot be accessed internally, only externally
   * internal - only this contract and contracts derived from it can access
